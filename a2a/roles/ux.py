## Principles
- Accessible, performant, consistent, resilient.

## Information Architecture
- Navigation hierarchy, page map, content grouping.

## User Flows
- Primary user journeys with pre/post conditions and variants.

## Components & States
- Component library, states (loading/empty/error/success), skeletons, responsiveness.

## Forms & Validation
- Input patterns, validation rules, error messaging.

## Accessibility
- WCAG AA, keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA usage.

## Theming & Styles
- Design tokens, layout grid, spacing/typography rules.

## Performance
- Budget, lazy loading, code splitting, caching.

## Testing
- Unit (components), integration (flows), E2E (critical paths), a11y testing.
